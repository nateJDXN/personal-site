## Hello and welcome to my first blog post!

I just finished building v1.0 of this website and am excited to keep the momentum going. I have always wanted to have an ongoing blog and this will be exactly that. I also plan to continue developing this website, with visual tweaks as I learn more skills as well as **easter eggs** :)


Thanks for reading and feel free to explore the site!
